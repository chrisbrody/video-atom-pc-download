ATOM 1.1 - Intro to video for atom
Hey friends! Chris from Codify Academy here.

In this video i'm going to show you how to download the text editor Atom for a PC.
This is the tool we going to use to write code that creates websites.

ATOM 1.2 - Going to atom.io
Make sure to have a google chrome open, then type atom.io into the search bar, press enter.

This website knows what operating system so you can click download installer.


ATOM 1.3 - Downloading Atom
Now we wait for the atom execute file to download
You might want to pause the video at this point,
it takes a minute.


ATOM 1.4 - Running the program google chrome
Once downloaded left click the .exe file to start the setup.

This also takes a minutes so again pause the video until that's done.

This is what atom looks like when its open.

ATOM 1.5 - Outro to video for google chrome
Nice and easy right?, you're almost fully prepared to call yourself a web developer, but for now we need a few more things.
 We'll revisit atom shortly.
